## A history lesson

### Invention of the web

In the beginning there was darkness. The [Sir Tim Berners Lee]() said “Let there be light”. And the web was born.

It wasn’t pretty, but no-one was any the wiser, because every site looked a bit like browsing the web in IE9 today (LOL).

#### Links/Demos

-The original web browser
-Site that demos your website in the original web browser – show London CSS site?

### Invention of CSS

### Tables

Content no longer had to flow in a linear way.

Anthropocene era of the web.

-Accessibility 😢
-Semantic markup 😢

All in all, this was a bad idea 💡❌

#### Links/Demos

-Screenreader reading a table-based layout

### Flash

Also badly inaccessible.

-Space Jam website
-Screenreader reading a flash layout [silence]

### Floats

Content is like a river. You “float” and element and other content flows around it. We started using them for layout.

Allowed up to retain semantic markup.

Feels very hacky, not their intended use.

-“Holy grail” layout

### Responsive Design

Developers had to do more. Websites started looking the same. We needed frameworks to help us.

#### References

-Bootstrap

### Flexbox

Flexbox is designed to be flexible.

## The present day

### Grid

The first time we’ve had a purpose-built layout specification.

-Media query-free layouts
-Algorithmic layouts
-2D layouts
-Intrinsic web design

### Custom properties

### CSS Shapes

Using floats for their intended purpose.

### The right layout method for the right purpose

I would still use `display: table` for an actual table!
